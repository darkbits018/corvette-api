# Remaining Tasks Based on Meeting Summary and Codebase

Looking at the meeting transcript and the codebase in `sc-siem-ingest.txt`, here's what still needs to be implemented or completed:

## 1. **Fluentd Configuration & Log Ingestion Pipeline**
- The codebase doesn't include any Fluentd configuration files or services
- Docker Compose has OpenSearch commented out (placeholder only)
- Need to implement Fluentd to:
  - Receive syslog logs on port 6514
  - Process logs with regex for source IP extraction
  - Forward to OpenSearch with proper index naming
  - Handle refused logs and error handling

## 2. **Alerting System Implementation**
- Models/alert.py is completely empty
- No alert-related routes or services exist
- Meeting mentioned: "if any error comes right, if error comes right, we will trigger email alerts"
- Need to implement:
  - Custom rule definitions
  - Alert trigger conditions
  - Email notification system

## 3. **IP Whitelisting/Blacklisting**
- routes/ips.py exists but is completely empty
- Meeting mentioned: "White listing of the IP addresses so which I from which IPs they need to block, they can do that"
- Need to implement:
  - IP management API endpoints
  - Validation of log sources against whitelist
  - Configuration to reject logs from non-whitelisted IPs

## 4. **Dashboard & Analytics Features**
- schemas/dashboard.py and models/dashboard.py are empty
- Meeting mentioned: "analytics will be there where a law means, based on the Matrix. We need to show some analytics"
- Need to implement:
  - Pie chart, histogram, and other visualizations
  - Aggregation endpoints for analytics data
  - Dashboard configuration API

## 5. **Index Template Management**
- While templates routes exist, the actual template files aren't in the codebase
- Meeting showed examples of templates for syslog, network logs, Windows logs
- Need to:
  - Create proper template JSON files for different log types
  - Implement automatic template registration on startup
  - Ensure templates are properly registered before index creation

## 6. **Daily Index Rotation**
- Meeting mentioned: "index will be rotated daily basis"
- Current code doesn't have logic for daily index rotation
- Need to implement:
  - Index naming convention (e.g., `syslog-2025-09-23`)
  - Daily index creation mechanism
  - Index retention policies

## 7. **Discover API Testing & Debugging**
- From meeting transcript (9/24/2025): "I'm having some errors with the parameters required for that. Like it starts by the timestamp maybe. I'm having a little bit error"
- Need to:
  - Verify time_range handling in build_opensearch_query()
  - Test filter combinations (term, match, range)
  - Ensure pagination works correctly with size/from parameters
  - Validate aggregations for analytics

## 8. **Docker Configuration**
- Current docker-compose.yml has OpenSearch commented out
- Need to:
  - Uncomment and configure OpenSearch service
  - Add Fluentd service
  - Ensure proper network configuration between services
  - Set up volume mounts for configuration files

## 9. **Security Enhancements**
- Meeting mentioned: "client wants like to this to be containerized" and "MFA-secured access"
- Need to:
  - Implement proper MFA for admin access
  - Ensure all endpoints have correct permission checks
  - Verify client_id restrictions for non-admin users
  - Add SSL/TLS for production deployments

## 10. **Frontend Integration**
- The codebase is backend-only (FastAPI)
- Need to:
  - Build React frontend based on the UI design discussed
  - Integrate with existing API endpoints
  - Implement dashboard components for analytics
  - Create user interface for alerts and IP management

## 11. **Documentation Updates**
- README.md needs to be updated with current API details
- Swagger documentation should reflect all implemented endpoints
- Add instructions for:
  - Setting up the full environment (Docker)
  - Configuring Fluentd
  - Managing indices and templates

## 12. **Testing & Validation**
- Need comprehensive testing for:
  - User role permissions
  - Index creation and deletion
  - Log discovery with various filters
  - Alert trigger conditions
  - IP whitelist enforcement

The meeting specifically highlighted that the Discover API is a priority - Abhay was working on it but had issues with parameters. The code shows the Discover API is partially implemented but needs thorough testing with real log data.

Also, the client wants the application to be containerized and easy to deploy, so the Docker setup needs to be fully functional with all components working together.
